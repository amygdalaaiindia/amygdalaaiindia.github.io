# Research

The AmygdalaAI-India Lab has established itself as a leader in cutting-edge AI and computer science research, with significant contributions in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Our work spans diverse domains, including healthcare (EEG signal classification, Parkinson’s detection, pneumothorax diagnosis), smart cities (firearm detection, violence recognition), and sustainability (climate impact analysis, smart agriculture). Published in top-tier venues like IEEE Access, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, and Multimedia Tools and Applications, our research emphasizes ethical AI, transparency, and real-world applicability. For instance, our transformer-based models for violence detection and vision-based military surveillance systems demonstrate how AI can enhance security while adhering to ethical guidelines. Collaborations with global institutions and a focus on data sovereignty ensure our solutions are both innovative and culturally contextualized.

Currently, we are expanding our research into federated learning for privacy-preserving AI, explainable models for clinical decision support, and edge-AI for low-resource settings. Projects like "ClipXpert" for automated video summarization and "Pose4Gun" for firearm detection highlight our commitment to human-centric AI. We are also exploring neurosymbolic AI to bridge the gap between data-driven learning and interpretable reasoning, particularly in BCI and medical diagnostics. Our interdisciplinary team collaborates with policymakers, industry partners, and NGOs to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies, aligning with India’s Digital India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.

Looking ahead, AmygdalaAI-India Lab envisions a future where AI serves as a force for equity, sustainability, and global collaboration. Our mission is to democratize AI innovation by prioritizing ethics, inclusivity, and sovereign data frameworks. Key focus areas include:

AI for Global Challenges: Scaling solutions for climate resilience, healthcare accessibility, and education.

Trustworthy AI: Developing robust frameworks for bias mitigation, algorithmic fairness, and adversarial robustness.

Collaborative Ecosystems: Partnering with academia, startups, and governments to foster open innovation.
With a vision to "Harness AI for a Just and Empowered Society," we aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and societal transformation, ensuring technology serves humanity’s highest ideals.
