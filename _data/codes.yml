  description: >
    The new Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix-based can also work with continuous value dataset:
    my_fuzzy_discrn_mat.py (for any number of features). Example:
    Irish_Evaluation_notebook.ipynb demonstrates both the feature selection techniques
    on standard Iris dataset.

  title: "Drones in Defence: Military Target Surveillance and Tracking"
  description: >
    This study presents a drone-captured video dataset for military surveillance and evaluates YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv11 models with their variants to balance accuracy and efficiency. The results show that YOLOv11s combined with ByteTrack achieves the best performance for real-time detection and tracking of enemy assets, advancing autonomous military surveillance.

  description: >
    Sound classification plays a vital role in urban planning and noise monitoring. Leveraging MFCCs and a 1D-CNN, we classify sounds from Bangladesh, India, and the UrbanSounds8k dataset. Our model demonstrates high accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of combining MFCCs with 1D-CNNs for urban sound classification.
